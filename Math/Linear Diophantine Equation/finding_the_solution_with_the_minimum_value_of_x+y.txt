we have to give some condition of the answer will be negative infinity

The idea is simple, we will find any solution of diophentine equation and after that shift it to satisfy some conditions

Let, 
    x' + y' is minimum
    x' = x + k*b/g
    y' = y -k*a/g
now,
    x' + y' = x + y + k*(b-a)/g 

if a>b, k should be largest possible
if b>a, k should be smallest possible
if b==a, there have same x+y for all solution
